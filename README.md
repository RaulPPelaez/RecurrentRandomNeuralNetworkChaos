# Timing and sequences from chaos in Recurrent Random Neural Networks

This is a project I did along Ernesto Segredo Otero for a Neurophysics class in the Master in Physics of Condensed Matter and Biological Systems I did at UAM.  

The work is based on [1] and attempts to reproduce their results. For that it trains a recurrent random neural network with a custom input and then studies some properties of the resulting, trained, network.  

The scripts in code/DATA/fig? will run and average the necessary simulations and render the figures in the presentation.  

The proyect also provides tools to get an input to train the network from a touch screen in an android device (see INPUT_FROM_TABLET).
